## Paper Abstract

The authors develop data-driven investment strategies for peer-to-peer lending using LendingClub data. The paper demonstrates how machine learning and data analytics can guide investment decisions, starting from raw data acquisition through to strategy evaluation. It serves as an educational case study for teaching data science concepts in a real-world business context.

## Key Contributions

1. **Return Calculation Methods**: Three different approaches to measuring loan returns
2. **Predictive Modeling**: Comparison of multiple ML algorithms for default prediction
3. **Investment Strategies**: From simple heuristics to sophisticated optimization
4. **Analytical Engineering**: Combining multiple models for improved performance
5. **Portfolio Optimization**: Integer programming formulations for loan selection
